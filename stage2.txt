i miss living with adam it was nice to have someone to talk to now all my social interactions are either on discord or study sessions i don’t do any fun shit anymore i miss home idk if san diego is my vibe it feels like one giant suburb what’s the point of having a job if the money i make is negligible to the money tuition costs
